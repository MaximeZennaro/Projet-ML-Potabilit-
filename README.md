## Project Description

The project involves the study of a data set on water quality. Today, access to water is one of the major problems of some developing countries but also in some regions of developed countries. It is also an important issue for sustainable development, particularly from an environmental and social point of view, but also from an economic point of view, with a view to developing water treatment infrastructure.

Our problem on this topic is the following: Find a prediction model allowing us to know whether a water is safe for consumption or not.
